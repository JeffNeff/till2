// Package graph provides primitives for building and traversing directed
// graphs.
//
// The implementation is purposely generic and could be used for representing
// any kind of data. In practice, the present tooling leverages graphs for
// representing the different messaging components of a Bridge, as well as the
// data flow between those components.
