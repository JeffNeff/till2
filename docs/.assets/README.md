SVG files in this directory were created using the free web editor at <https://app.diagrams.net/>.

Each SVG file embeds a copy of the original diagram data, making it both a graphics _and_ a source file that can be
imported and edited again in this editor.

When exporting a diagram as SVG using the editor at diagrams.net, make sure to:

* Select the option **"Include a copy of my diagram"** to retain the possibility to perform future modifications.
* Set a zoom value of **150%**, the default of 100% tends to be rather small for most diagrams.
